# WorkApp
command line productivity tool for managing tasks; written in 12h for Alphasheets
1) Put “work” (the script) into your bin folder (then run $chmod +x work)
2) Put “WorkApp” into your home directory
3) Run “work” or “work email” from command line

Let me know if there are any issues, there may have been some difficulty uploading to dropbox.

Source code is available in WorkApp/src
